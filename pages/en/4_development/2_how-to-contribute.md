# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing, We're humbled and to be honest, a bit excited ^_^.  
There are many ways you can help advance Superpowers!

## Preamble

Superpowers adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/tree/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

As a new contributor, we want you to feel welcome and comfortable.
You're not going to break anything, so feel free to experiment.
We appreciate it when people follow the conventions detailed below,
but if you're unsure about where to post, pick a place that makes sense to you
and someone will point you to the right one if needed.

### Superpowers's source code [is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/superpowers)

 * [superpowers/superpowers](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers) — Superpowers's core
 * [superpowers/superpowers-game](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game) — The Superpowers Game system
 * [superpowers/superpowers-html5.com](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-html5.com) — Superpowers's website
 * [superpowers/docs.superpowers-html5.com](https://github.com/superpowers/docs.superpowers-html5.com) — Superpowers's documentation

Other systems and plugins might be hosted elsewhere by other developers unaffiliated with the Superpowers project.

## Reporting and triaging bugs

Bugs should be reported on GitHub. When in doubt, feel free to open an issue on [the core repository](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers).

You can help triage bugs and make them more useful by:

 * Asking bug reporters which platform (Windows, OS X or Linux, 32-bit or 64-bit) and which browser/app version they're using.
 * Trying to reproduce the bug with the latest development version of Superpowers on any platform possible and reporting your findings.
 * If you can't reproduce the bug, it's worth sharing that too and maybe ask for more details!

## New features and suggestions

The core development team uses [a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/eQUeNKrq/superpowers) to keep track of planned features.

Ideas and suggestions for new features should be posted [on the forum](http://itch.io/t/9542/the-superpowers-game-maker-megathread) `FIXME: Link?`.
Once a feature proposal gets support and traction in the community,
you can create an issue on GitHub to discuss its design in details before moving on to implementation.

## Documentation

The documentation website is written in Markdown.
New pages should be treated as new features, following the same proposal and discussion process outlined above. 

`FIXME: It should probably be rewritten as a Superpowers project and published on GitHub Pages?!`

## Sending a pull request

 * Make your pull request as small as possible. Don't bundle many unrelated changes together.
 * Try to stick to the existing coding style. You can use the `tslint` plugin in Visual Studio Code to help.
