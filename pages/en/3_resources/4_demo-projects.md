# Demo projects

Instructions for setting up a project can be found on each project's page. Generally, it involves going to the Downloads page and unzipping them into [your `projects` folder](/en/getting-started/setting-up-superpowers), then restarting your server.

You can find all kinds of demos and example projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/superpowers-extra) (in the process of migrating from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sparklinlabs/profile/repositories?search=superpowers-)) to learn various aspects of the software.
