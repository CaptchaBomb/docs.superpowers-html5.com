# Collaborating in real-time

By default, your server will only accept connections from the computer it is running on.

<div class="action">
  <p>To open up your server to others, setup a password in the Settings and stop/start the server.
</div>

<div class="note">
  <p>**You'll probably need to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=setting%20up%20port%20forwarding" target="_blank">configure your home router</a>** and/or firewall to allow (or forward) inbound TCP connections on the port numbers your server is listening on (4237 and 4238 by default).
</div>

Once your server is open, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=my%20ip" target="_blank">get your public IP address</a> and you can send a link of the form `ip:port` to the people you want to work with (e.g.&nbsp;`1.2.3.4:4237`). They can either paste this link in their browser's address bar to join without installing anything or add it to their Superpowers servers list from the launcher.

<div class="note">
  <p>**Make sure to share your public IP address** with those you want to collaborate with. `127.0.0.1` is a special address that always points to the computer you're using it on, so others won't be able to connect to your server with it.

  <p>The simplest way to get your public IP address is to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=my%20ip" target="_blank">ask Google</a>.
