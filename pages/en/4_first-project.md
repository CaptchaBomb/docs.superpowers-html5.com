# Creating your first project

<div class="action">
  <p>Click on `New Project`, enter a name and description.  
  Double-click on your project's name to open it.
</div>

A project is made of a tree of folders and assets. Asset editors are provided by plugins.  
Superpowers comes with a bunch of plugins to import sprites, 3D models, sounds, build scenes, write scripts and more.

<div class="note">
  <p>**Documentation for creating your own plugin is coming soon.** Feel free to look around in the `app/plugins` folder until then.
</div>

You can rearrange your project's assets however you want by dragging them around.
Double-click on an asset to open its editor in a tab, or use the "Open in a new window" icon instead.
