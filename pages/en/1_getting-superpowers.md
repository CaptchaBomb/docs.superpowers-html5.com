# Getting started

<div class="note">
  <p>You can [contribute to this documentation on Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/superpowers/docs.sparklinlabs.com).
</div>

Superpowers is still under development. You can choose to support us over at <a href="https://sparklinlabs.com/" target="_blank">SparklinLabs.com</a> to get early access.  
Or wait a few months and Superpowers will be open source and free to use for everyone :)

## Conventions

In this guide, whenever you should do something, it will appear like this:

<div class="action">
  <p>This is an action you should take.
</div>

Important notes and troubleshooting information will appear in boxes like this one:

<div class="note">
  <p>This could be an important note, don't miss it!
</div>
