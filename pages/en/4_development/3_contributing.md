# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing, We're humbled and to be honest, a bit excited ^_^.

We're not quite ready to start accepting pull requests for Superpowers.  
We're currently stabilizing the core of the project and will be open sourcing in the next few months.

You're still welcome to share your patches with the community if you fixed something in your local copy of Superpowers!
