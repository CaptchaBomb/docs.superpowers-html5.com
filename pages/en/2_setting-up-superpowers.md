# Setting up Superpowers

<div class="action">
<p>Download the correct ZIP for your platform from <a href="https://sparklinlabs.com/account" target="_blank">your account page</a>.  
Unzip it in a convenient location and double-click on `Superpowers`.  
The launcher will start. Click anywhere to dismiss the splash screen.
</div>

You'll see a list of servers and your own local server should start up right away.

<div class="note">
  <p>**On Linux and OS X**, the default port (80) might only be accessible to administrators.  
  If the server fails to start, go to the Settings pane and type in a port number â‰¥ 1024.

  <p>Make sure to edit the address of your "My Server" entry in the servers list to use the correct port.
</div>

<div class="note">
  <p>**On Windows**, Skype might be already listening on port 80, preventing the Superpowers server from starting.  

  <p>You can either change the port Skype uses in its settings or change the Superpowers server port as described above.
</div>

Double-click on "My Server" and a window will open. You'll be asked to choose a username.  
This is not yet linked to your Superpowers account but you probably want to use the same.
