# Building plugins

The plugin system will undergo some changes soon to support multiple project types (so people can build games but also game servers or maybe even apps or books with Superpowers) so we're holding off until that work is done before documenting it all.

If you can't wait, Florent Poujol [shared his thorough notes about plugin development](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51314747/superpowers/plugins_info.html) so check those out!

We've also got [a few example plugins you can learn from](https://bitbucket.org/sparklinlabs/profile/repositories?search=superpowers-plugin).
