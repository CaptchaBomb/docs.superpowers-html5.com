A project is made of a tree of folders and assets.
An asset is the generic name for any basic part of a project, like a sprite, a scene or a script.

You can rearrange your project's assets however you want by dragging them around.
Double-click on an asset to open its editor in a tab, or use the "Open in a new window" icon instead.
