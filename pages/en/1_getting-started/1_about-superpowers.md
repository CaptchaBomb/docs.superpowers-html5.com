# About Superpowers

Superpowers is an HTML5 development environment for making 2D and 3D games.  
It can be extended with plugins and lets you collaborate in real-time.

[Watch the intro video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7XoWWvGPd4)

Superpowers is still under development. You can choose to support us over at <a href="https://sparklinlabs.com/" target="_blank">SparklinLabs.com</a> to get early access.  
Or wait a few weeks and Superpowers will be open source and free to use for everyone :)

## Conventions

In this guide, whenever you should do something, it will appear like this:

<div class="action">
  <p>This is an action you should take.
</div>

Important notes and troubleshooting information will appear in boxes like this one:

<div class="note">
  <p>This could be an important note, don't miss it!
</div>
