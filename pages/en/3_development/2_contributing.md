# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We're not quite ready to start accepting pull requests for Superpowers yet.  
We're currently stabilizing the core of the project and will be open sourcing in the next few months.

If you want to write your own plugins, Florent Poujol [shared a lot of useful information](https://www.reddit.com/r/superpowers/comments/38x7lr/plugins_knowledge_dump/) on Reddit.
